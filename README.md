- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on compiler performance optimizati. The work content mainly focuses on the compiler back-end parts such as IR/CFG/SSA/GC/JIT/LLVM.
- ðŸ’¬ Recently, I plan to sort out my compiler-related knowledge system and build a compiler toy to further learn Gc/Slp/Ai-compiler related content.
